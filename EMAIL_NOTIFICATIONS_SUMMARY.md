## 🚀 Next Steps to Complete Setup

### 1. SendGrid Account Setup
1. Create account at [sendgrid.com](https://sendgrid.com)
2. Get API key from dashboard
3. Verify sender email address
4. Update backend `.env` file with real credentials

### 2. Backend Deployment
Choose one of these options:
- **Heroku** (recommended for beginners)
- **Railway** (easy GitHub integration)
- **Vercel** (good for serverless)

### 3. Frontend Configuration
Update the backend URL in `EmailNotificationService.ts`:
```typescript
this.baseUrl = __DEV__ 
  ? 'http://localhost:3001/api'
  : 'https://your-deployed-backend-url.com/api';
```

## 🧪 Testing

The backend has been tested and works correctly:
```bash
# Health check - ✅ Working
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
# Response: {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"...","service":"email-notification-service"}

# Test email - ⏳ Needs real SendGrid API key
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/send-test-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userEmail": "test@example.com"}'
```
